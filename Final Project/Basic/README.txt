Final Project of Computer Architecture and Organization
Tim Liming and Wing Tung Yuen

The test bench of this project is in cpu_tb.v.
The number of cycles is 100.
The time that the program should run is 2000ns (2us).

The program should also include the following files:
add4.v, 
adder.v,
ALU.v, 
ALU_control_unit.v, 
control_unit.v, 
cpu.v,
memory.v,
mux2to1.v,
mux2to1_5bit.v, 
ProgramCounter.v, 
registerfile.v, 
ShiftLeft2.v, 
SignExtend.v
